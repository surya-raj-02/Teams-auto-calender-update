# Teams-auto-calender-update
Automatically adds all scheduled meetings of microsoft teams to calender 
# Installation
This program required Python 3 to run... Now better go and install it.
Clone the repository and extract the folder.
After that...
```sh
$ cd Teams-auto-calender-update
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt 
$ python3 run.py
```
If you want to see everything happening automatically... run:
```sh
$ python3 run.py -o
```
or
```sh
$ python3 run.py --show-output

Rest of the usage is pretty self-explainatory... so Enjoy.
